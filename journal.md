9th June 2016 - Created Rails Project.

At the end of this entry, I will track this project using git. The idea behind this file is to document my thought process. I find it easier to write all of this down as I usually tend to revisit the things I've done before for introspection. I find that it helps me think. Right now, I am in the process of selecting a grid system for the project. I had used bootstrap for a similar project about 2 years back, but where's the fun in using something that you've already used before? I think I'll use this opportunity to try out [Foundation](http://foundation.zurb.com).
I also plan to make a minimalistic blog- I used wordpress and I used Tumblr, but let's just say that either of those platforms don't make me feel like I'm blogging anymore. So immediate aims include building a static page. Long term aims include researching what goes into making the backend of the blog.
I know that I've to generate a controller for the static pages. Will start off with that first.
